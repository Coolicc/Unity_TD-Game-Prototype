# Unity: TD Game Prototype

A Tower Defense game prototype I made for the Unity course at Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. Made in Unity game engine, it uses C# for the scripts. It is a simple tower defence game with a few levels, some different types of turrets and enemies, turret upgrade system, and turret shop. I did make use of some stock assets that come with Unity.
